ckpt 1:
0.25 c/s: 2 VMs
0.3 c/s: 3 VMs
0.5 c/s: 4 VMs
0.6 c/s: 4 VMs
0.75 c/s: 6 VMs
1 c/s: 6 VMs
1.25 c/s: 6 VMs
1.5 c/s: 8 VMs

a lot of timeouts happen before other VMs boot up? what can be done to reduce/prevent this?
2s load measuring + 5s boot time = 7s until optimal VMs
first middle VM: 5s boot time
